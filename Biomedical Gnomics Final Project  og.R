#Biological Question: Do the type of antibody influence cell binding?

#Hypothesis: The cross reactivity between the antigens and synthetic type of antibody  will have a  greater binding because the synthetic antibodies are better attuned to binding with the antigens.

#Statistical Null Hypothesis (H0): No effect (equal Âµ, no significant between the average optical density of the  antibodies)



#Bases on the antibodies  generated against the ospC antigens which  types of antibody were involved  ?

#select the distinct rows from a data set and deletes repeated information
#selects the types of antibody and antibodies generated against  the ospC antigens
